## Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course assignment

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to collect, work with, and
clean a data set, in order to prepare tidy data that can be used for later
analysis.

The data used in this project represent data collected from the accelerometers
from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The variables, the data, and any
transformations or work performed to clean up the data are detailed in file
`CodeBook.md`.
